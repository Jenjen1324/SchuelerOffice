SchuelerOffice
==============

This program is written in C# and is used to help students to manage their work.

I (Jenjen1324) made this Project because I had to make a project (of whatever type) for school. So I came up with this Idea.


Planned features:
  - Storing marks
    - View graphs of progress
    - Calculate marks needed to get a certain mark in your certificate (or whatever it's called)
  - Learing vocabulary
    - Make your own vocabularies
    - Share them on a server
    - Download other vocabularies
  - Managment of homework
    - Write your homework in a database
    - Sync with your class
    - Teacher can put homework in your class database

More to come and I'm open to suggestions



Note: Since I do this program for my school and I live in Switzerland the labels and texts are written in German.
If anybody can tell me on how to efficiently change languages in a program tell me and I will try to implement more languages.
